/** \page architecture Architecture
 *
 * <h2> Introduction </h2>
 * Sirikata provides the basic services and functionality needed by virtual
 * world applications.  Applications tie these services together and build on
 * top of them to provide a unique experience to end users.
 *
 * Sirikata breaks an entire virtual world system -- including the components
 * executed by end users -- into three high level services: the object hosts,
 * the space, and the content distribution network.  These services loosely
 * correspond to computation, communication, and storage, respectively.
 *
 * To deploy a virtual world application, the application developer will provide
 * a single space service (possibly distributed across many servers) which is,
 * in some sense, the "world."  Depending on the application, the provider might
 * also run object hosts, which connect to the space and run objects provided by
 * the world (the scenery and bots in a game, for example), and a CDN to handle
 * storage of large, static data, such as geometry, textures, and prerecorded
 * audio. As described later, clients connect to the world by running an object
 * host locally which, at a minimum, simulates their avatar or camera object.
 *
 * This high level description leaves out a lot of detail, but gives an idea of
 * what is involved in building and deploying a virtual world using Sirikata.
 * Note that this configuration isn't the only one possible -- for instance, a
 * CDN might not be provided and all resources might either be directly
 * deivered, as in a procedurally defined world, or the provider might not
 * provide a CDN, relying on users to find hosting, for example via web
 * hosting.  In this manual we hope to describe the most common deployment,
 * making note of alternatives where appropriate.
 *
 * With this high level context, the following describes each of these
 * components in a bit more detail, but focuses on each of their external
 * interfaces.  For details on the internal architectures of these components,
 * including ways in which they can be customized and extended, see their
 * corresponding architecture pages:
 *  - \ref space_architecture
 *  - \ref oh_architecture
 *  - \ref cdn_architecture
 *
 * <h2> Space </h2>
 * In some sense, the space is the actual world: it enables all interaction
 * between objects, it is the medium by which objects learn about each other and
 * communicate. From the perspective of objects connected to the space, it
 * provides three services: presence (also known as space membership, session
 * management, authentication), physical simulation, and interobject
 * communication.
 *
 * <h3> Authentication and Presence </h3>
 * Spaces enable objects to communicate and enforce the constraints of the
 * virtual world. First, when an object wants to enter the world, the space acts
 * as the guardian, deciding whether or not an object should be able to enter.
 * The policy for allowing entrance is left up to the application developer.  In
 * existing systems this step usually only applies to clients connecting to the
 * world -- most systems conflate the simulation of individual objects with the
 * simulation of the world, and lack flexible policies on object admission,
 * aside from user accounts.  One common example of this step in traditional
 * systems is admission control for load balancing purposes -- a world may only
 * allow a few hundred players to connect to a given space or region of the
 * world at a time to control load.
 *
 * Once an object has been granted access to the world, it must provide the
 * space with all the necessary information for the world to simulate it (note
 * that this might actually occur
 * as part of the admission process to enable full consistency and
 * representation as soon as admission is granted). Certain properties of the
 * object are actually controlled or owned by the space itself -- for instance
 * the object's position, orientation, and mesh -- so that the space can make
 * sure the world is simulated consistently.  We defer further discussion
 * of this issue to \ref authoritative_state.  However, application level state
 * is maintained in the object itself, so the space maintains (and needs to know
 * about) relatively little state for each connected object.
 *
 * <h3> Discovery </h3>
 * Once all the necessary proprties of an object are available to the space,
 * the only barrier to objects communicating with each other is discovery: the
 * space provides a query mechanism which allows objects to discover other relevant
 * objects in the space. Objects register a query (its not necessary to
 * understand the form, a common example from existing systems would be "objects
 * within 100m"), and the space provides continuous updates, providing each
 * object with a list of other objects that are currently relevant to it.
 *
 * <h3> Communication & Messaging </h3>
 * Finally, with references to these other objects in hand, a connected object
 * may communicate with them via messages.  The lowest level communication
 * between objects is unreliable unordered messages, but Sirikata also provides
 * higher level transport abstractions to make writing object scripts simpler.
 *
 * <h3> Extensions - Other Services </h3>
 * The above services are the minimum shared services required to run a virtual
 * world. Note the lack of any discussion of physics simulation, inventory
 * services, VOIP, or any other complicated services commonly available in
 * today's virtual worlds. These are higher level services which are not common
 * to all applications and sometimes do not make sense in some applications.
 *
 * For more internal details of the space and how to extend it, see the \ref
 * space_architecture.
 *
 * <h2> Object Host </h2>
 * The object host handles simulation of objects and provides utilities for them
 * to interact with the space, other objects, and the CDN. It is where object
 * scripts (or behaviors) are loaded and run.
 *
 * The object host has 3 main duties:
 *  - Object simulation, including running object scripts, performing any local
 *    physical simulation that may be necessary
 *  - Session management for objects, including communication for basic services
 *    such as location management, proximity queries, and message routing.
 *  - Expose utilities to objects.  Examples might include persistent storage,
 *    higher level communication abstractions, timers, an inventory service,
 *    animation utilities, and so on.
 *
 * In some sense, the choice of scripting language is just an extension of the
 * first and third duties.  Because we define a network protocol which the
 * components use to communicate, the choice of scripting language is not fixed
 * -- as long as the language can encode our messages (or connect to our library
 * which can encode the core set of messages), it can work with the rest of the
 * system.  Scripts written in a convenient scripting language such as Python,
 * Lua, or Ruby are just one way to extend objects.  The object host may also
 * provide other extensions (implemented as plugins) which provide other fixed
 * functionality for objects via the same extension interface.  Examples of
 * these might be timers, an interface for web requests, or an inventory
 * service.
 *
 * For more internal details on the object host and how to extend it, see the
 * \ref oh_architecture.
 *
 * <h2> Content Distribution Network </h2>
 * The content distribution network is used to store and distribute large,
 * static, long-lived content.  Some examples include meshes, textures, and
 * object scripts. Although we can take advantage of its use in a virtual world
 * to optimize it, the content distribution network looks very similar to
 * existing solutions for other applications. We take advantage of this by
 * leveraging existing solutions.
 *
 * The CDN supports two levels: names and content. The inputs to the CDN are
 * always URIs. All URIs can respond with data directly.  However, the preferred
 * organization is to use a hash URI for direct data storage. This allows
 * efficient storage, replication, and flexibility in the source of the data
 * (e.g. direct from the provider, via a torrent, etc).  Then, when referring to
 * the content, for example when specifying a mesh, a human readable URI is
 * used. This attaches some semantic meaning the URL and allows changes to be
 * made in hierarchical resources without requiring large adjustments (for
 * instance, changing a texture only requires pointing the name URI at a
 * different hash URI; since the mesh refers to the named resource its hash
 * doesn't change and so the content for the mesh remains the same but now
 * points to the new texture).
 *
 * The CDN should support additional features that are especially useful in this
 * context -- attaching certain types of standard metadata, range requests, and
 * hashes on partial data to allow for safe use of partial data for lower levels
 * of detail.  More information can be found in the detailed \ref
 * cdn_architecture documentation.
